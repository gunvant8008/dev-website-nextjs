<p>Next.js is a framework built on top of React.js, and it offers several benefits over using React.js alone. Here are some of the main advantages of using Next.js:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Server-side rendering: Next.js provides server-side rendering, which can significantly improve the performance and SEO of your application. With server-side rendering, the initial HTML of the page is generated on the server, and then the JavaScript is loaded on the client side. This means that users can see the content of your website faster, and search engines can more easily crawl your website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically code-splits your application, which means that only the code necessary for a specific page is loaded when that page is requested. This can help reduce the load time of your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy deployment: Next.js makes it easy to deploy your application to a variety of hosting services, including Vercel, which is optimized for Next.js applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static site generation: Next.js allows you to generate static sites, which can improve the performance of your application and reduce the cost of hosting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hybrid Rendering: Next.js allows you to mix and match SSR and SSG as needed, which can help you achieve the best performance for your application. You can use SSR for frequently updated pages and SSG for less frequently updated pages to improve the performance of your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incremental Static Regeneration: Next.js provides incremental static regeneration (ISR), which allows you to update static pages without rebuilding the entire site. This can help you update pages more quickly and improve the overall performance of your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Built-in routing: Next.js provides built-in routing, which can simplify the process of creating a multi-page application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Next.js provides several benefits over using React.js alone, particularly when it comes to performance, SEO, and deployment. If you are building a complex web application, or if you are concerned about performance and SEO, then Next.js may be a better choice for your project.</p>
