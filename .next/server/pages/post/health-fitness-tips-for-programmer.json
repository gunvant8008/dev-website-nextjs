So i think i am eligible to talk about balancing the crucial fitness part of life while being a developer.\n\nAs a programmer, you likely spend long hours in front of a computer, typing away at a keyboard, and staring at a screen. While this can be rewarding work, it can also take a toll on your physical and mental health. Here are some actionable practical tips to help you take care of your health and fitness as a programmer-\n\n![My Image](/images/myImage.png)\n\nYes, it's me!. Only adding picture so that a logical brain will take me seriously.\n\n## 1. Learn about human body a little bit\n\nDo your own research or hire a coach for short period of time & learn about basic health & fitness science so that you can become independent for your health, like-\n\n### a. Calculating Calories-\n\nIf you want to lose or gain weight, this is the area which will give you the result.\n\n### b. Learn About Your Food-\n\nPeople think they are eating enough but when they actually calculate their food they find out they are miles away from their body's real requirements.\n\nBoth of these can be achieved by logging your food daily in apps like- Fat Secret , My Fitness Pal\n\n### c. Educate yourself for fat, muscle & different types of exercises\n\nUnderstand what muscle and fat are, how these increase or decrease in a human body. What are the outcomes of cardio exercises & weight lifting exercises.\n\nThese 3 things will make you very confident in your fitness journey.\n\n## 2. Do complete body checkup (Full blood test) every 6 months or a year\n\nThis will give you the real picture of inside of your body and the vital organs. Sometimes we find out about diseases early by this & sometimes disturbed blood reports shows us the reality of how we are abusing our body and gives us the real motivation to work on our health.\nSo don't ignore this.\n\n## 3. Take Exercise as your job\n\nA few years back, When i started to thing about my body, i realized how little i was doing for my body in respect to what was is doing for me!\nFrom that day i took it as a job, I made health & fitness in my top 3 daily priorities.\n\nExercise is important for everyone, but it's especially important for programmers who spend a lot of time sitting. Regular exercise can help improve your mood, reduce stress, and improve your overall health. Try to find an exercise routine that you enjoy and stick to it.\n\n## 4. Keep track of your posture\n\nPoor posture can lead to a range of health problems, including back pain and neck pain. Make sure to sit with your back straight and your feet flat on the ground. Position your monitor at eye level and use a chair with good lumbar support.\n\n## 5. Eat healthy mostly, Don't abuse food and body\n\nA healthy diet is essential for good health and fitness. As a programmer, it can be tempting to snack on junk food and sugary drinks throughout the day. However, these foods can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Instead, try to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.\n\n## 6. Drink enough water\n\nDehydration can lead to a range of health problems, including fatigue and headaches. Make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.\n\n## 7. Get enough sleep\n\nSleep is essential for good health and fitness. As a programmer, it can be tempting to work late into the night and sacrifice sleep. However, this can lead to a range of health problems, including fatigue, weight gain, and other issues. Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n\n### Thank you for reading, and let's connect!\n\nThank you for reading my blog.
