## How Does Tailwind CSS Work?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means that it provides a set of utility classes that can be used to style HTML elements. These classes are designed to be composable, which means that they can be combined to create more complex styles.

Tailwind CSS provides over 400 utility classes that can be used to style elements. These classes are organized into categories such as layout, typography, colors, borders, and more.

Here is an example of using Tailwind CSS classes to style a button element:

```html
<button
  class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
>
  Click me
</button>
```

In the example above, we are using Tailwind CSS classes to style a button element. Here is what each class does:

- bg-blue-500: Sets the background color of the button to blue with a shade of 500. You can use different shades of colors like 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900.
- hover:bg-blue-700: Changes the background color of the button to a darker shade of blue when the mouse is hovered over it.
- text-white: Sets the text color of the button to white.
- font-bold: Sets the font weight of the button text to bold.
- py-2: Sets the padding on the top and bottom of the button to 2 units of the default spacing.
- px-4: Sets the padding on the left and right of the button to 4 units of the default spacing.
- rounded: Rounds the corners of the button.
